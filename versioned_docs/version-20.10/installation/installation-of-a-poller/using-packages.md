Centreon provides RPM packages for its products through the Centreon Open
Sources version available free of charge in our repository.

These packages have been successfully tested in CentOS 7 and 8 environments.

> Due to Red Hat's stance on CentOS 8, we suggest not to use said version for
> your production environment. Nevertheless, these packages for CentOS 8 are
> compatible with RHEL 8 and Oracle Linux 8 versions.

## Pre-installation steps

### Disable SELinux

SELinux should be disabled. To do this, you have to edit the file
**/etc/selinux/config** and replace **enforcing** by **disabled**, or by
running the following command:

```shell
sed -i s/^SELINUX=.*$/SELINUX=disabled/ /etc/selinux/config
```

> Reboot your operating system to apply the change.

After system startup, perform a quick check of the SELinux status:

```shell
$ getenforce
Disabled
```

### Configure or disable firewall

Add firewall rules or disable the firewall by running the following commands:

```shell
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld
```

> You can find instructions [here](../../administration/secure-platform.md#enable-firewalld) to configure firewalld.

<Tabs groupId="sync">
<TabItem value="RHEL / CentOS / Oracle Linux 8" label="RHEL / CentOS / Oracle Linux 8">

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.sh -u <API_ACCOUNT> \
-t poller -h <IP_TARGET_NODE> -n <POLLER_NAME>
```

Example:

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.sh -u admin -t poller -h 192.168.0.1 -n poller-1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CentOS 7" label="CentOS 7">

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.sh -u <API_ACCOUNT> \
-t poller -h <IP_TARGET_NODE> -n <POLLER_NAME>
```

Example:

``` shell
/usr/share/centreon/bin/registerServerTopology.sh -u admin -t poller -h 192.168.0.1 -n poller-1
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Replace **<IP_TARGET_NODE>** by the IP of the Centreon server seen by the poller or by the Remote Server if you
> want to link your server to it.

> The **<API_ACCOUNT>** must have access to configuration API. You can use default **admin** account.

> If you need to change the HTTP method or the port, you can use the following format for the **-h** option:
> HTTPS://<IP_TARGET_NODE>:PORT

Then follow instructions by
1. Entering your password:

    ``` shell
    192.168.0.1: please enter your password:
    ```

2. Select the IP adress if multiple network interfaces exist:

    ```shell
    Which IP do you want to use as CURRENT NODE IP ?
    1) 192.168.0.2
    2) 192.168.0.3
    1
    ```

3. Then validate the information:

    ``` shell
    Summary of the informations that will be send:
    
    Api Connection:
    username: admin
    password: ******
    target server: 192.168.0.1
    
    Pending Registration Server:
    name: poller-1
    type: poller
    address: 192.168.0.2
    
    Do you want to register this server with those informations ? (y/n)y
    ```

You will receive the validation of the Centreon central or the Remote Server server:

``` shell
2020-10-16T17:19:37+02:00 [INFO]: The CURRENT NODE 'poller': 'poller-1@192.168.0.2' linked to TARGET NODE: '192.168.0.1' has been added
